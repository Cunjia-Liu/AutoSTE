# Information-theoretic search of an atmospheric release using a mobile sensor

This package contains the example code for performing intelligent search and source term estimation of an unknown airborne release. It covers a series of algorithms developed by our reserach group in this subject area.

More details regarding the underlying algorithms can be found in the following references.

 
Note that the intention of this example code is to help people get familar with the working pricinples of informatin theoretic planning in the context of source team estimation. It  does not serve to document the code used in these papers.
